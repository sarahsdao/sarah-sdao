I am both a technical writer and a librarian, offering a unique perspective on documentation. 

That means I consider:
 
|   **how things are written** 
|  *(is this documentation skimmable? what voice is this? will this make sense to the audience for which it's intended?)*
|
|        along with 
|
|  **how things are organized and accessed** 
| *(what metadata exists for this information? is this documentation easily searchable or discoverable?)*
