I am both a technical writer and a librarian, offering a unique perspective on documentation. 

That means I consider:
 
|    **how things are written**
|  *(are things spelled correctly? is proper grammar used? will this make sense to the audience for which it's intended?)*
|
|        along with 
|
|    **how things are organized and accessed** 
| *(why is this section of text not included back there? should this be ordered differently? is this easily searchable?)*
