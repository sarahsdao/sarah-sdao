I am both a technical writer and a librarian, offering a unique perspective on documentation. 

That means I consider:
 
**how things are written**
*(is this documentation skimmable? what voice is this? will this make sense to the audience for which it's intended?)*
       
 along with 

**how things are organized and accessed** 
*(what metadata exists for this information? is this documentation easily searchable or discoverable?)*
